God Bless Selenium and Node.js

## Setup
run these one-after-another:
```
npm init
npm install
node main
```

## Rename the config-sample.js to config.js 

## Setup and run the Selenium server and give the right port number and server ip in config.js

### You may refer to this docker container I made and instantly setup the selenium: https://github.com/iliaamiri/selenium-on-Linux-setup-dependencies

*!!! don't forget to keep that config.js file safe from any accesses !!!*
